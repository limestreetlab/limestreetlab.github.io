raw data are in pdf formats by year
cambridge table formats are different from oxford, so must be read and parsed individually 
there is one pdf2csv script is for cambridge, and one for oxford
raw yearly data files are converted into csv one by one, based on input and output paths provided

after the raw pdf files are converted into csv, another script aggregates the data in all individual csv files into one master json file; 
when the master file is ready, another script identifies and marks any sixth form colleges to sixth form instead of public, based on a sixth form school list.

cambridge files can show NA if original file postcodes are inputted incorrectly, ignore those
