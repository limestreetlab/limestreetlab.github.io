raw data are in pdf formats by year
cambridge table formats are different from oxford, so must be read and parsed individually 
one pdf2csv script is for cambridge, one for oxford
raw yearly data file is converted into csv one by one, based on input and output paths provided by user

after the raw pdf files are converted into csv, another script aggregates the data in all csv files in the input folder into one json file

cambridge files can show NA if original file postcodes are inputted incorrectly, ignore those
