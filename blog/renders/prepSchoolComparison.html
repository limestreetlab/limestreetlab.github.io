        <p class="mt-4 mb-4">
        Despite the notoriously and astonishingly high cost of private school education in England, we still believe it is worth pursuing given the very mixed populations and dubious quality of public schools in many parts of London.
        <br><br>
        We have high expectations for Easy Baby. We want her to achieve very high academic success while pursuing music and sports at a competitive level. 
        We aim for an environment that is academically ambitious and rigorous to stretch Easy Baby's mind but also offers rich extra-curricular activities to broaden her experience and pastoral care to build happiness and confidence.
        It is critical to identify the right prep schools having the right ethos and offering Easy Baby a home-away-from-home to grow intellectually and personally in her formative years.
        <br><br>
        While an excellent all-through school such as Highgate, NLCS, and Alleyns is attractive, all prep schools are considered on equal basis because Perse and St Paul's and public grammar schools Pate's and Tiffin remain our primary exit goals. 
        The base case exit point is 11+, but 7+ is not totally written off. Given the competitive nature of admission, a variety of schools is  considered to balance entry reality and our objectives. Location is a secondary consideration as we are <i>just</i> renting and can move to accomodate. 
        <br><br>
        To evaluate and compare, we select academic quality, exit track record, music program, sport offerings, foreign language curriculum, facilities, niceness and convenience of location, and cost as evaluation criteria, to which we assign weights of 30%, 5%, 15%, 5%, 20%, 10%, 5%, 10%, accordingly.

                        Unargurably the top girls school. Academic attainments and placements are top-notch. Academic outcomes are achieved without sacrificing extracurricular experience, as music, languages, and art offerings are beyond an average prep.
                        <br><br>
                        Girls are very ambitious, high-achieving, and mature. Facilities are very good, with access to some of St Pauls Girls'. 
                        <br><br>
                        Entry is so competitive that reception entry is by ballot only. With historically over 300 applicants and an automatic sibling policy for 30 places, selection probability is in mid-single digit. Entry is not a matter of if I want but if I can.

                        A large French bilingual school spanning primary and secondary. It follows the French curriculum and mixes French/English instructions, leading to bilingual fluency. Facilities are new and good with science lab, playgrouynd, gym, and music room on site. 
                        <br><br>
                        Extracurricular activities are basic, which is common in the French system. Academically it is not ambitious and made clear that it is a French school not a prep school. Parents looking to exit at 11+ are frankly told substantial external tutoring and extra efforts are needed, because the French curriculum does not cover as much breadth as required for 11+.
                        <br><br>
                        Pupils are comfortably bilingual but look intellectually mediocre. The fee level is competitive and the school is popular with French families. It should suit families emphasising bilingualism rather than academics.

                        <div class="mt-2 small"><!--review here-->
                        It is a beautiful school, in a leafy area at the top of the hill towards Hampstead, aiming to provide a well-rounded education and nurturing experience without sacrificing academic quality, which I think it does well. In fact, the school explicitly states it sits in the middle between academic rigour and happiness. 
                        <br><br>
                        Music and language offerings are not excellent, with merely 30mins per week. French lessons increase to 3 per week from year 3, but most pupils admit they can not speak much. Music clubs, individual lessons, and choirs are available, but music does not seem an integral part of school. Senior school placement record is good but not excellent.
                        <br><br>
                        Teachers and staffs are approachable, professional, and honest. Pupils looked happy, friendly, confident, and polished. Pupil body is relatively diverse, mostly drawn from wealthy Hampstead families. The school consists of 3 buildings nearby with spacious and well-maintained sport facilities and playgrounds at the back, enjoying leafy and open views. There is even a cozy forest school area, but the library is just average. Science lab, music room, and IT room are good. Class rooms are spacious and do not feel crammed at all. A school bus is available from St Johns Wood. The fee level is high and above other Hampstead preps, which I don't see well justified.

                        <div class="mt-2 small"><!--review here-->
                        Located across Clapham Common, the school site is split into a boys and a girls school, seperated only by classrooms and activities. Key facilities such as canteen, science lab, gym, and playground are shared between the two <i>schools</i>. The school feels quite crowded and facilities look mediocre. The views are either surrounding buildings or indoor, not of nature even the Common is opposite.
                        <br><br>
                        In terms of academics and placements, it meets my expectations of a prep school, but does not exceed. During the visit, reception and year 6 girls proactively and correctly answered questions; but those questions were not particularly challenging. Girls looked hardworking and well-mannered, but intellectually below Bute House's level.  
                        <br><br>
                        Music is 1 hour/week with optional private lessons on site; French is 30mins/week which is very little; language doesn't seem a priority as a nursery staff teaches Spanish just because she speaks Spanish and then it changes to French from reception. Sports should be mediocre given the limited facilities and often having to use the Common. The weekly ballet lesson is interesting thoughg.
                        <br><br>
                        In conclusion, this is an average school without any particular selling points or strengths.

                        Ecole de Battersea teaches the French curriculum by incorporating English instructions. Pupils and staffs are all fully bilingual. Academically it is not ambitious and will certainly not suffice to prepare for 11+. The school is rather small and very crammed. Student-teacher ratio is high. Facilities including the library are poor. Extracurricular offerings are very limited. It is by and large <i>just</i> a French school in London.

                        Popular among French families, this is a small and cute school comprising one residential building with basement and a decent backyard. Staffs are friendly, passionate, and knowledgeable about educating small children. It offers French-heavy, English-heavy, and bilingual programmes under the same French curriculum, only varied by language instructions. 
                        <br><br>
                        Music and sport offerings are basic given the limited facilities. Sports and meetings are done in a basement hall. A small library and an art/music room are also in the basement. Academically, it is not ambitious as it mostly follows the French national curriculum. The supermajority of pupils leave for Ecole de Battersea for CP. 
                        <br><br>
                        Located in the south of Fulham in a residential area, it is a nice location but not too convenient with Parsons Green station 20 minutes walk away. Wednesday is morning-only and mid-term breaks are two weeks requiring some logistic arrangements. With its focus on 3-6 only, it has a much better feel than Ecole de Battersea.

                        <div class="mt-2 small"><!--review here-->
                        A 7+ pre-prep school that very recently started 11+ prep. Pupils primarily exit at 7+ and the entire school is geared to that. As a result, English and math are at the centre, while other subjects and extracurriculars take a back seat. From reception, homeworks are assigned on a daily basis as well as weekend reading. 
                        Looking at the school works, pupils seem to learn topics one term ahead of other preps, math in particular. 7+ placements are strong, reflecting the academic calibre of its pupils. 
                        <br><br>
                        The school is located in a former church site, comprising the main church building for Y1/Y2, a small rear building for reception, and a few makeshift container-like structures for nursery. The container classrooms should be cold in the winter. The church hall is used for sports, dance, and meetings. There are no rooms for science, arts, IT, and music, so all lessons take place inside the classrooms; in fact, pupils have meals in the classrooms too.
                        <br><br> 
                        Even the school purports it offers rich extracurriculars, it is hard to believe given the lack of facilities. The pupils basically spend the whole day in their classrooms. Even foreign language teaching, which is Spanish, looks scant.
                        <br><br> 
                        In sum, it is a small academically-oriented school that does a good job preparing for 7+ at the expense of extracurriculars and a nurturing experience, which can be made up later at a top senior school.

                        A family-owned school that is currently managed by the 3rd generation. The key building in Hans Place which houses senior students has a strong traditional feel with squeaky wood floors and wooden classroom furniture. Even with over 500 students, it still has a family feel.
                        <br><br>
                        The school is spread across Knightbridge and Chelsea, with 3 school sites housing different year groups and a building (founder's hall) for drama/arts/music/sports. The sites are not that close, so students get bused around between the school and founder's hall.
                        <br><br>
                        Tied to its family values, the school has strong focus on extracurriculars; pupils have a weekly swimming sessions and 2 music sessions with optional private lessons. A high proportion play a musical instrument, probably due to the types of family choosing the school and its embracement of music. Art is also central, with pupil works displayed throughout the school. 
                        <br><br>
                        Academics and placements are on par with other prep schools, starting 11+ from year 5. Pupils are diverse with 10% black and 20% Asian. It is a good choice for well-rounded education in central London.

                        A popular independently-operated prep in the Richmond area located near Kew Gardens, with close to 300 pupils. 
                        <br><br>
                        For a nonselective school, it prides itself on strong academics and placements, with Latymer/Godolphin/Hampton/LEH being key destinations. Language-wise, French is only 30mins/week and not a school priority.
                        <br><br>
                        The school is compact and comprises 3 buildings (early years, senior years, and lab/art/music rooms) with a small playground at the centre. There are no sport facilities on site, so it rents surrounding facilities for sports, which is a bit unfortunate for a school in Richmond. Music is decent with private lessons available.
                        <br><br>
                        Pupils look happy and well-mannered. The body is diverse, about 50% white, 30% Asian, 20% brown. Staffs are friendly and approachable.   
                        <br><br>
                        In sum, I find it a friendly school offering above-average academics and average extracurriculars at below-average fee in a cozy environment.

                        With over 600 pupils, it is a large prep school in a relatively central area. Academics, placements, and extracurriculars are those generally expected of a prep school. Facilities are abundant and good for a London prep, with a music hall, music rooms, gym, playgrounds, labs, and IT rooms. The school is surrounded by rails and highways, without view of nature; the benefits of its good facilities are offset by the above-average cost and poor location.
