        <p class="mt-4 mb-4">
        Despite the notoriously and astonishingly high cost of private school education, we still believe it is worth pursuing given the very mixed demographics and dubious quality of public schools in London.
        We aim for an environment that is academically ambitious and rigorous but also offers rich extra-curricular activities and pastoral care.
        <br><br>
        To evaluate and compare, we select academic quality, exit track record, music program, sport offerings, foreign language curriculum, facilities, niceness and convenience of location, and cost as evaluation criteria, to which we assign weights of 30%, 5%, 15%, 5%, 20%, 10%, 5%, 10%, accordingly.

                        <div class="mt-2 small"><!--review here-->
                        A franchised prep of Brighton College operated by Cognita group. It is housed in a beautiful Georgian building in South Ken next to Imperial. It is posh and spacious despite its prime location; it also can access a sizeable rear garden of Imperial.
                        <br><br>
                        I feel that this school is more form than substance in the sense that it feels more like a marketing machine than a serious school. The staffs look and act nicely almost like in a business setting; the glossy brochures highlight primarily the key decision criteria of parents such as A-level results and university destinations by Brighton College, which have absolutely nothing to do with this franchised prep. Managers talk like salesmen rather than educators. The open morning began with a piano performance by its music teacher with coffee and pastry, typical in real estate events.
                        <br><br>
                        Academically, it is unclear whether it produces results because the franchise is quite new. However, I see its curriculum is largely on par with other preps. Worth noting that it does <b>not</b> feed directly into Brighton College and 11+ is needed. Extracurriculars are also average and foreign languages are not well-coordinated. Its library is centrally located so people can <i>see</i> it instead of in a quiet area and serious books are lacking, further indicating the lack of substance.
                        <br><br>
                        In sum, this school is an average prep sugar-coated with the Brighton College brand and its prime posh building, primarily targeting wealthy families in Kensington or abroad looking for a posh education.

                        Unargurably the top girls school. Academic attainments and placements are top-notch. Academic outcomes are achieved without sacrificing extracurricular experience, as music, languages, and art offerings are beyond an average prep.
                        <br><br>
                        Girls are very ambitious, high-achieving, and mature. Facilities are very good, with access to some of St Pauls Girls'. 
                        <br><br>
                        Entry is so competitive that reception entry is by ballot only. With historically over 300 applicants and an automatic sibling policy for 30 places, selection probability is in mid-single digit. Entry is not a matter of if I want but if I can.

                        <div class="mt-2 small"><!--review here-->
                        A large French bilingual school spanning primary and secondary. It follows the French curriculum and mixes French/English instructions, leading to bilingual fluency. Facilities are new and good with science lab, playgrouynd, gym, and music room on site. 
                        <br><br>
                        Extracurricular activities are basic, which is common in the French system. Academically it is not ambitious and made clear that it is a French school not a prep school. Parents looking to exit at 11+ are frankly told substantial external tutoring and extra efforts are needed, because the French curriculum does not cover as much breadth as required for 11+.
                        <br><br>
                        Pupils are comfortably bilingual but look intellectually mediocre. The fee level is competitive and the school is popular with French families. It should suit families emphasising bilingualism rather than academics.

                        <div class="mt-2 small"><!--review here-->
                        It is a beautiful school, in a leafy area at the top of the hill towards Hampstead, aiming to provide a well-rounded education and nurturing experience without sacrificing academic quality, which I think it does well. In fact, the school explicitly states it sits in the middle between academic rigour and happiness. 
                        <br><br>
                        Music and language offerings are not excellent, with merely 30mins per week. French lessons increase to 3 per week from year 3, but most pupils admit they can not speak much. Music clubs, individual lessons, and choirs are available, but music does not seem an integral part of school. Senior school placement record is good but not excellent.
                        <br><br>
                        Teachers and staffs are approachable, professional, and honest. Pupils looked happy, friendly, confident, and polished. Pupil body is relatively diverse, mostly drawn from wealthy Hampstead families. The school consists of 3 buildings nearby with spacious and well-maintained sport facilities and playgrounds at the back, enjoying leafy and open views. There is even a cozy forest school area, but the library is just average. Science lab, music room, and IT room are good. Class rooms are spacious and do not feel crammed at all. A school bus is available from St Johns Wood. The fee level is high and above other Hampstead preps, which I don't see well justified.

                        <div class="mt-2 small"><!--review here-->
                        Located across Clapham Common, the school site is split into a boys and a girls school, seperated only by classrooms and activities. Key facilities such as canteen, science lab, gym, and playground are shared between the two <i>schools</i>. The school feels quite crowded and facilities look mediocre. The views are either surrounding buildings or indoor, not of nature even the Common is opposite.
                        <br><br>
                        In terms of academics and placements, it meets my expectations of a prep school, but does not exceed. During the visit, reception and year 6 girls proactively and correctly answered questions; but those questions were not particularly challenging. Girls looked hardworking and well-mannered, but intellectually below Bute House's level.  
                        <br><br>
                        Music is 1 hour/week with optional private lessons on site; French is 30mins/week which is very little; language doesn't seem a priority as a nursery staff teaches Spanish just because she speaks Spanish and then it changes to French from reception. Sports should be mediocre given the limited facilities and often having to use the Common. 
                        <br><br>
                        In conclusion, this is an average school without any particular selling points or strengths.

                        Ecole de Battersea teaches the French curriculum by incorporating English instructions. Pupils and staffs are all fully bilingual. Academically it is not ambitious and will certainly not suffice to prepare for 11+. The school is rather small and very crammed. Student-teacher ratio is high. Facilities including the library are poor. Extracurricular offerings are very limited. It is by and large <i>just</i> a French school in London.

                        Popular among French families, this is a small and cute school comprising one residential building with basement and a decent backyard. Staffs are friendly, passionate, and knowledgeable about educating small children. It offers French-heavy, English-heavy, and bilingual programmes under the same French curriculum, only varied by language instructions. 
                        <br><br>
                        Music and sport offerings are basic given the limited facilities. Sports and meetings are done in a basement hall. A small library and an art/music room are also in the basement. Academically, it is not ambitious as it mostly follows the French national curriculum. The supermajority of pupils leave for Ecole de Battersea for CP. 
                        <br><br>
                        Located in the south of Fulham in a residential area, it is a nice location but not too convenient with Parsons Green station 20 minutes walk away. Wednesday is morning-only and mid-term breaks are two weeks requiring some logistic arrangements. With its focus on 3-6 only, it has a much better feel than Ecole de Battersea.

                        <div class="mt-2 small"><!--review here-->
                        A 7+ pre-prep school that very recently started 11+ prep. Pupils primarily exit at 7+ and the entire school is geared to that. As a result, English and math are at the centre, while other subjects and extracurriculars take a back seat. From reception, homeworks are assigned on a daily basis as well as weekend reading. 
                        Looking at the school works, pupils seem to learn topics one term ahead of other preps, math in particular. 7+ placements are strong, reflecting the academic calibre of its pupils. 
                        <br><br>
                        The school is located in a former church site, comprising the main church building for Y1/Y2, a small rear building for reception, and a few makeshift container-like structures for nursery. The container classrooms should be cold in the winter. The church hall is used for sports, dance, and meetings. There are no rooms for science, arts, IT, and music, so all lessons take place inside the classrooms; in fact, pupils have meals in the classrooms too.
                        <br><br> 
                        Even the school purports it offers rich extracurriculars, it is hard to believe given the lack of facilities. The pupils basically spend the whole day in their classrooms. Even foreign language teaching, which is Spanish, looks scant.
                        <br><br> 
                        In sum, it is a small academically-oriented school that does a good job preparing for 7+ at the expense of extracurriculars and a nurturing experience, which can be made up later at a top senior school.

                        <div class="mt-2 small"><!--review here-->
                        A family-owned school that is currently managed by the 3rd generation. The key building in Hans Place which houses senior students has a strong traditional feel with squeaky wood floors and wooden classroom furniture. Even with over 500 students, it still has a family feel.
                        <br><br>
                        The school is spread across Knightsbridge  and Chelsea, with 3 school sites housing different year groups and a building (founder's hall) for drama/arts/music/sports. The sites are not that close, so students get bused around between the school and founder's hall.
                        <br><br>
                        Tied to its family values, the school has strong focus on extracurriculars; pupils have a weekly swimming sessions and 2 music sessions with optional private lessons. A high proportion play a musical instrument, probably due to the types of family choosing the school and its embracement of music. Art is also central, with pupils' works displayed throughout the school. 
                        <br><br>
                        Academics and placements are on par with other prep schools, starting 11+ from year 5. Pupils are diverse with 10% black, 15% Asian, 15% brown. It is a good choice for a well-rounded education in central London.

                        A traditional Catholic girls school with a sizeable campus and impressive facilities located in a quiet upscale residential area. There is ample outside space; the spacious sports ground and beautiful library are better than most secondary schools. Music rooms, arts rooms, IT rooms, and performance hall are also modern. Despite being a days school in Kingston, the experience is like a boarding school in a suburb.
                        <br><br>
                        It is a happy and homely school but also academically strong with solid placements into LEH, Tiffin, and Wimbledon High. It is a well-rounded school offering both academics, extracurriculars, and experience; the weaknesses are in modern language (French) and daily commute which requires a car.

                        The London campus of a well-established Paris bilingual school. Compared to other French/English bilingual schools in London, it is more international and has a stronger pedagogical focus, making its curriculum more integrated and advanced.
                        <br><br>
                        The school integrates the French and English curricula rather than simply following either; for example, while it follows the French curriculum, its math teaching combines the intuitive and hands-on style in the English system, and also begins fractions earlier than the French system. The staffs and teachers are very knowledgeable about different education approaches and able to integrate the best elements into the classrooms.
                        <br><br>
                        Language-wise, it is very good at bilingual teaching. It also introduces Mandarin from middle school. While it does not teach individual instruments, pupils have one music lesson per day using the Kodaly method.  
                        <br><br>
                        Its target demographics is largely French-related families in London, so there is a smaller pool to draw students from compared to prep schools; hence, student quality is not as high as selective preps. Petite section to grande section are housed in the basement, so not as nice an environment as in L'Ecole des Petits.

                        A bilingual school, following the English curriculum with English and Chinese instructions. It is like a British international school in China. Super-majority of pupils have Chinese family connections.
                        <br><br>
                        The school shares a site with a public primary, occupying only the top floor and a back playground, so pupils have to walk up and down the stairs frequently. Facilities are minimal, with a hall for music and meetings and an activity room for arts and science.
                        <br><br>
                        Academically, it claims to be 18 months ahead of national curriculum, measured by test scores. Math adopts the Chinese teaching method to promote deeper understanding. Placement results are good. Most teachers are Chinese and many pupils do not look polished. It offers reasonably strong academics and Chinese immersion, but not extracurriculars.

                        A popular independently-operated prep in the Richmond area with less than 300 pupils. 
                        <br><br>
                        For a nonselective school, it prides itself on strong academics and placements, with Latymer/Godolphin/Hampton/LEH being key destinations. Language-wise, French is only 30mins/week and not a school priority.
                        <br><br>
                        The school is compact and comprises 3 buildings (early years, senior years, and lab/art/music rooms) with a small playground at the centre. There are no sport facilities on site, so it rents surrounding facilities for sports, which is a bit unfortunate for a school in Richmond. Music is decent with private lessons available.
                        <br><br>
                        Pupils look happy and well-mannered. The body is diverse, about 50% white, 30% Asian, 20% brown. Staffs are friendly and approachable.   
                        <br><br>

                        A traditional boys school of over 400 pupils transitioned to co-education in 2024 so student body is still predominantly boys. The school is split into 3 buildings (nursery, junior, senior) within walking distance of each other in a quiet residential area. 
                        <br><br>
                        The school is academically strong across all core subjects as well as computing and arts. The placements are solid, consistently many off to St Pauls and Hampton. The school is expecting to replicate the success in girls placements. Many boys look intellectual and well-mannered. The population is 90% white and 10% Asian.
                        <br><br>
                        French is the selected foreign language, which number of lessons increases gradually. Music is pretty decent, with individual lessons available on site and school choirs. Sports are plenty with cricket being highly popular. In terms of facilities, there are sport grounds, rooms for music/arts/IT, a library, and a performance hall.
                        <br><br>
                        In sum, I find it a friendly and well-established school offering a well-rounded traditional prep education with strong exit records and good facilities.

                        A school housed in two connected Victorian buildings primarily targeting wealthy international families in central London. The head said it is an <i>(exclusive)</i> international school with a strong English flavour. 
                        Its curriculum is a mixture of the English curriculum and International Baccalaureate and is designed to be broad and enriching. It is academically decent and offers a well-rounded experience with good music and sports.
                        <br><br>
                        Pupils are well-mannered and polished, apparently from well-to-do backgrounds. They are also very confident and proactive in class. While the topics might not be advanced, teaching seems interesting and broad and teachers are good at engaging students. While pupils are happy, well-rounded, and academically good, many are probably not academically prepared enough for top senior schools, so placements are just average, mostly into similarly posh and expensive but academically-average schools such as Harrodian and Francis Holland.
                        <br><br>
                        Given the targeted demographics, the tuition fee is priced at the very top end and I imagine there are many ultra-rich families conspicuously flaunting their wealth, making families outside that subset uncomfortable.

                        A small pre-preparatory school housed in a traditional building off Putney centre and is owned by Harrodian. Historically a boys-only school, it is still very boys-heavy, with some classes having over 80% boys. 
                        <br><br>
                        While it prepares for 7+ exits similar to <i>Hampstead Hill</i> and <i>Mulberry House</i>, this school is more like a traditional prep with a gentle and easy-going style, making the academic pace simply in-line with standard preps. 
                        The school has a very homely atmosphere and pupils are not under pressure. Pupils seem well-behaved, but not particularly ambitious or intellectual. Despite academic pace does not seem accelerated, the placement record is pretty decent. For some reason, Friday is half-day only.

                        <div class="mt-2 small"><!--review here-->
                        A small pre-preparatory school of 220 pupils, led by a young and energetic team. Due to its focus on 7+ exits, the curriculum is inevitably academic and fast-paced. Children learn phonics and maths about one term ahead of other preps. It only gives suggested activities, but not homework.
                        <br><br> 
                        The <i>full-time</i> schedule unusually runs from 8:30 to 17:45, but classes end at 3:30 with snacks and staff-led activities follow led by school teachers. 7+ placements are strong, especially Highgate, NLCS, SHHS. The school embraces the use of technology. Pupil population is diverse, with a high proportion of brown and Asian.   
                        <br><br>
                        Location is not so nice as it is on the Kilburn main road but towards Hampstead in another direction. Outside space is lacking, and sports are done in a small hall and a <i>carpeted</i> rooftop area. The school is popular and currently at capacity; entry into reception depends on how many pupils exit at 4+, so can be easier if apply for a space a term prior to reception and then automatically transfer up.

                        With over 600 pupils, it is a large prep school in a relatively central area. Academics, placements, and extracurriculars are those generally expected of a prep school. Facilities are abundant and good for a London prep, with a music hall, music rooms, gym, playgrounds, labs, and IT rooms. The school is surrounded by rails and highways, without view of nature; the benefits of its good facilities are offset by the above-average cost and poor location.

                        A small family-owned school in Wandsworth relatively close to the park. It offers a Spanish immersion program for up to Y2 for young children to absorb the language. Due to this and its location, the population is very diverse in social class and ethnicity with many black, brown, and south americans. It is a basic and friendly school, but academics and extracurriculars are just average. Students do not look intellectual or ambitious.

                        Academics and placements are decent, but not exceptional. Many receive music scholarships from senior schools.

                        A pre-prep school under the King's College School umbrella; it is a key feeder into King's College Junior even entry assessment is still needed. King's College is transitioning to co-educational in a decade, starting from reception in 2027. This school has the advantages of being an academically strong pre-prep, a more balanced curriculum and better facilities compared to other pre-preps, and strong links to King's College. The disadvantages are that it will remain a very boys-heavy school for a long time as the co-ed transition will be slow and Wimbledon is slightly far from central London.
