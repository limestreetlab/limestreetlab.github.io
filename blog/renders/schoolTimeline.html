        <p class="mt-4 mb-4">
        After many <a href="./prepSchoolComparison.html">school visits</a>, we have come to the conclusion that London schools offer very diverse value propositions, ranging from exam orientation (such as Hampstead Hill) and musical culture (especially St Paul's Cathedral) to language immersion (like Jeannine Manuel) and exclusiveness (such as Knightsbridge). 
        <br><br>
        Our decision is a bilingual school first to take advantage of early years language development, and then an academically strong prep school to prepare for selective secondary school entry down the road.

        <p class="mt-4">
          In terms of academics, we are basically indifferent between Kensington, Glendower, and Wimbledon, but currently lean towards the former two due to their girls school status, richer extracurricular offerings, and central locations; Wimbledon, however, has the advantages of being a 7+ prep and feeder to Kings.
