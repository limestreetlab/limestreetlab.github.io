<div id="problem">

  There are two customer service counters in a store that are currently occupied.
  <br>
  Mr. Musk arrives and waits for the next available counter.
  <br>
  The service time is known to be exponentially distributed with parameter $\lambda$.
  <br>
  What's the probability that, of the three customers, Mr. Musk is the last to leave customer service?
  
</div>

<div id="solution">

  When a counter becomes available, Mr. Musk enters and the other one is still in service.
  <br>
  Given service time is exponentially distributed, it is <i>memoryless</i>, such that it is as if the service time for that other person were just starting.
  <br>
  Hence, by symmetry, the other service counter finishes before Mr. Musk finishes is $\frac{1}{2}$.
