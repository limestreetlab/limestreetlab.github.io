<div id="problem">
Tiger is taking a one-hour test. <br>
Suppose the probability that Tiger will finish the test in less than $x$ hour is $\frac{x}{2}$, for all $0\leq x \leq 1$.
<br>
Given that Tiger is still working after $0.75$ hour, what's the probability that the full hour is used?
  
</div>

<div id="solution">

Let's $L_t$ denote the event Tiger finishes in less than $t$ hour and $F$ the event that the full hour is used.
<br><br>
Note that
$$
  P(F) = P(L_1^c) = 1 - P(L_1) = 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}
$$
Also, the probability that Tiger is still working at $0.75$ hour is $P(L_0.75^c)$, so the desired probability is

\begin{align}
  P(F | L_{0.75}^c) &=  \left( \frac{P(F)\cap P(L_{0.75}^c)}{P(L_{0.75}^c)} \right) \\
  &= \left( \frac{P(F)}{1-P(L_{0.75})} \right) \\
  &= \left( \frac{0.5}{0.625} \right) \\
  &=  0.8
\end{align}
