<b>Gambler's ruin</b>
<br>
In a classical gambler's ruin situation where Tony and Sally bet on successive coin flips, Tony wins $\$1$ from Sally on a head and Sally wins $\$1$ from Tony on a tail.
<br>
Tony starts with $\$i$ and Sally with $\$(N-i) $ so $\$N$ is the total money in the pot. 
<br>
They keep playing until one is broke.
<br>
The coin flips are independent, and each flip has constant probability $p$ of landing a head.
<br><br>
Derive the general formula for the probability that Tony will win.
<br>
What if the coin is fair such that $p = \frac{1}{2}$ and Tony starts with $\$5$ and Sally with $\$10$? What if the coin is instead biased having $p = 0.6$?

<div id="solution">
The derivation is by doing basic algebra and making use of the assumptions and obvious facts to result in a recursive pattern.
<br><br>
Let $E$ denote the event of Tony winning when he starts with $i$. Let use $P_i$ to denote $P(E)$ to make clear how $E$ might depend on $i$.
<br>
Letting $H$ denote a head on the 1st flip, we can express $P(E)$ by conditioning it on the 1st flip as
\begin{align}
  P(E) = P_i &= P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|H^c)P(H^c) \\
  &= P(E|H)p + P(E|H^c)(1-p)
\end{align}
Because of independence and constant probability,
\begin{align}
  P_{i+1} &= P(E|H) \\
  P_{i-1} &= P(E|H^c)
\end{align}
Letting $q = 1 - p$,
$$
  P(E) = P_i = p \cdot P_i + q \cdot P_i = p \cdot P_{i+1} + q \cdot P_{i-1} \tag{1}\label{1}
$$
Re-arranging \eqref{1},
$$
  P_{i+1} - P_i = \frac{q}{p}(P_i - P_{i-1}) \tag{2}\label{2}
$$
Boundary conditions $P_0 = 0$ and $P_N = 1$ are obvious. 
<br>
Using \eqref{2} for $i = 1, 2, 3, \ldots , N-1$, 
\begin{align}
  P_2 - P_1 & = \frac{q}{p}(P_1 - P_0) = \frac{q}{p}P_1 \\
  P_3 - P_2 & = \frac{q}{p}(P_2 - P_1) = (\frac{q}{p})^2 P_1 \\
  P_4 - P_3 & = \frac{q}{p}(P_3 - P_2) = (\frac{q}{p})^3 P_1 \\
  \vdots \tag{3}\label{3} \\
  P_i - P_{i-1} & = \frac{q}{p}(P_{i-1} - P_{i-2}) = (\frac{q}{p})^{i-1} P_1 \\
  \vdots \\
  P_N - P_{N-1} & = \frac{q}{p}(P_{N-1} - P_{N-2}) = (\frac{q}{p})^{N-1} P_1 \\
\end{align}

Now, summing the first $i -1 $ equations of \eqref{3},
$$
  P_i - P_1 = P_1\left((\frac{q}{p})^1 + (\frac{q}{p})^2 + (\frac{q}{p})^3 + \ldots + (\frac{q}{p})^{i-1} \right) 
$$
Giving, 
$$
P_i = 
\begin{cases}
P_1 \left( \frac{1-(q/p)^i}{1-(q/p)} \right) \qquad & \text{if} \frac{q}{p} \neq 1 \tag{4}\label{4}\\
iP_1 \qquad & \text{if} \frac{q}{p} = 1
\end{cases}
$$

Setting $i=N$ and using $P_N = 1$ in \eqref{4},
$$
  P_1 = 
  \begin{cases} 
  \frac{1-(q/p)}{1-(q/p)^N} \qquad & \text{if} \frac{q}{p} \neq 1 \tag{5}\label{5} \\
  \frac{1}{N} \qquad & \text{if} \frac{q}{p} = 1
  \end{cases}
$$
Substituting \eqref{5} into \eqref{4},
$$
P_i = 
\begin{cases}
\frac{1-(q/p)^i}{1-(q/p)^N} \qquad & \text{if} \frac{q}{p} \neq 1 \tag{6}\label{6}\\
\frac{i}{N} \qquad & \text{if} \frac{q}{p} = 1
\end{cases}
$$

\eqref{6} is the desired formula for P(E), the probability that Tony wins by starting with $i$ .
<br><br>
For $p=\frac{1}{2}$, $i = 5$, and $ N = 15$,
$$
  P(E) = P_5 = \frac{5}{15} = \frac{1}{3}
$$
If the coin is biased having $p = 0.6$, then $P(E)$ jumps to
$$
  P(E) = P_5 = \frac{1-(2/3)^5}{1-(2/3)^{15}} \approx 0.87
$$
Hence, $P(E)$ is rather sensitive to increasing $p$ and $\frac{i}{N}$.
