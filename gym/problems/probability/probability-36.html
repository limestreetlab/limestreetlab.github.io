<div id="problem">
From a shuffled deck of 52 cards, a card is turned up one at a time until an ace appears.
<br>
Given that the first ace appears on the $20^{th}$ card, what's the probability that the card following it is the:
<ol>
<li>ace of diamonds?</li>
<li>five of hearts?</li>
</ol>

</div>

<div id="solution">
a.
<br>
Let $E_{Ad}$ denote that event that the next card is the ace of diamonds, then
\begin{align}
  P(E_{Ad}) & = P(\text{next card is an ace}) \cdot P(E_{Ad} | \text{next card is an ace}) \\
  & = \frac{3}{32} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{128} \approx 0.023
\end{align}
<br>

b.
<br>
Let $E_{5h}$ denote the event that the next card is the five of hearts, and $E_{\text{5h in 20}}$ that the five of hearts appears in the first 20 cards.
<br>
Then, 
\begin{align}
  P(E_{5h}) & = P(E_{5h} | E_{\text{5h in 20}}) \cdot P(E_{\text{5h in 20}}) + P(E_{5h} | {E_{\text{5h in 20}}}^c) \cdot P({E_{\text{5h in 20}}}^c)   \\
  & = 0 \cdot \frac{19}{48} + \frac{1}{32} \cdot \frac{29}{48} \\
  & = \frac{29}{1536} \approx 0.019
\end{align}
